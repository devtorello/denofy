# 🦕 Denofy
Hey, there! Welcome to Denofy! This is supposed to be a wrapper to the Spotify API developed in Deno, so we can integrate it easier in our projects.

## 🚧 Is it under development?
Yes! This is just the initial concept, so, until the end of the project, probably a lot of things are going to change. So yeah, this is a WIP repository.
